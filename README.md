# First plugin: PDFMultiMerge 
PDFMultiMerge will take pdf files and merge them together in the order the user likes. The app takes a set of PDF files as Item A, and a different set of PDF files from as Item B. The items are paired...item A[0] is merged with item B[0], item A[1] is merged with item B[1].. so on and so forth.
